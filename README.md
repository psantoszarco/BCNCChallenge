## Build Process

* To execute the proyect: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=Â»com.inditex.ecommerce.EcommerceApplication
* To compile the proyect: mvn clean install

## Build With

* Domain-Driven Design: The code is separated into folders according to the following configuration.

    - UseCase: Application business, includes the data mapper.
    - Domain: Application domain, includes

        - repository: Database communication layer.
        - services: Application services

* Testing
    - Architecture test: Architecture test with some basic rules to comply with DDD rules
    - Unit test: Unit tests covering functional units, by applying TDD for the realization of the project, 100% of the business code has been covered and almost 100% of the rest of the code.
    - Integration test: e2e test with a h2 dabatase in memory

* Jacoco
  jacoco has been added to generate a coverage report after each test run, this report is placed in target/site/index.html.
